# CS and CV: Vision-Based Intelligent Vehicle System (IVS) with Speed Control 🚗💡

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores a **vision-based Intelligent Vehicle System (IVS)** capable of **adaptive speed control** using **Computer Vision (CV) and Deep Learning (DL)**.

We leverage **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** for real-time detection of **road elements** such as:

* 🚧 Speed bumps
* 🚦 Traffic signs (speed limits, stop signs, etc.)
* 🚶 Obstacles / pedestrians (future scope)

The detected elements are fed into a **control system** that dynamically regulates vehicle speed, ensuring **safety, efficiency, and adaptability**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Develop a **cost-effective IVS prototype** using a standard camera and embedded hardware.
* Train a **lightweight YOLO model** for real-time detection and classification.
* Implement **decision logic** for adaptive speed control with fail-safe mechanisms.
* Integrate detection + control into a **working hardware prototype**.

## 🛠️ Project Phases

### **P1: Dataset & Model Training**

* Collect dataset of **speed bumps** and **traffic signs**.
* Train YOLO model for multi-class detection.
* Evaluate performance with accuracy, precision, and inference speed.

### **P2: Hardware Integration**

* Setup **camera** on embedded platform.
